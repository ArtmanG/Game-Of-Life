# Resources for Web

These are some resources that _might_ be useful. There's no requirement
that you use HTML canvas for this project. You could use DOM elements,
or a game engine, or whatever you choose.

Instead of doing the pixel manipulation, below, you could use drawing
primitives to draw rectangles on the canvas, for example.

Be creative. Anything is allowed, as long as it meets MVP. If in doubt,
ask!
